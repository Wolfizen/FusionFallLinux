        ATTENTION! In order for this game to install successfully, the launcher needs to be run a single time to download extra required files.

        Steps:
          * At the end of the following installer, check the box to "Run FusionFall Universe".
          * Log in to your FusionFall Universe account.
          * Press "Play Now" in the launcher.
          * The game will start, and then exit with an error. This is expected.
          * Close the launcher.
