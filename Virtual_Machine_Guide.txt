Virtual Machines can run Windows games in Linux where other options do not work. FusionFall is not a demanding game and should run fine even on a low-power computer. I can run on max settings with my integrated Intel chip.

1. Download your favorite flavor of virtual machine. I prefer OracleBox.
2. Give the guest machine maximum video memory, and enable 2D/3D acceleration.
3. Install Windows. I tested with 10, anything 7 or later will work.
4. Download and install Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable 2015 x86 AND x64.
5. Download and install Microsoft .NET Framework 4.7.2.
6. Run the installer. The launcher and game should start successfully.
7. If you have mouse movement issues ingame, I recommend disabling Mouse Integration for your VM and/or changing the input device to PS/2 mouse.
