1. Download your favorite flavor of virtual machine. I prefer OracleBox.
2. Give the guest machine maximum video memory, and enable 2D/3D acceleration where possible.
3. Install Windows. I tested with 10, anything 7 or greater should work fine.
4. Download and install Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable 2015 x86 (32-bit version is important!).
5. Download and install Microsoft .NET Framework 4.5.2.
6. Run the Retro Early-Access installer. The game should start successfully.
7. If you have mouse movement issues ingame, I recommend disabling Mouse Integration for your virtual machine and/or changing the input device to PS/2 mouse.
