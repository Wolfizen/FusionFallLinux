Tools to run FusionFall on Linux

[FusionFall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartoon_Network_Universe:_FusionFall) is a MMO based
on Cartoon Network's shows and characters. [FusionFall Universe](https://www.fusionfalluniverse.com/)
is a community dedicated to bringing back this game, as the official servers were shut down in 2013.

This repo hosts my work on getting the FusionFall Universe releases to run on Linux.

## Legacy
As of now, no launcher or runnable game has ever been released for Legacy.

## Retro
The _first_ Retro preview worked on Linux (using Pipelight). I personally have not been able to get the subsequent iterations
working. Try it yourself, I have posted my progress so far.
